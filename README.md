# Using Center Loss
This repo aims to show how to use [Center Loss](http://ydwen.github.io/papers/WenECCV16.pdf) on [Fashion Mnist](https://github.com/zalandoresearch/fashion-mnist) dataset with Keras.
</br>
# Usage
Just run `wrn.py`. Fashion Mnist can be downloaded automatically. If you have some connection problems, just download from other sources and put the dataset into `./data/fashion` directory. In this case, the test result is bad.
